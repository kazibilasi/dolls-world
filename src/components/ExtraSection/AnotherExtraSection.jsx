                <p>I started making dolls in 2002, following my dream and now I am the most famous doll designer in my home city. Step by step, with reading craft books and magazines, with trial and error method and talking and seeing how old masters work I gained skills and confidence in crafting. In April 2013 the US Fashion Academy awards me with the first „Golden needle”. Since 2014, I run a doll store in San Diego.</p>
